# Welcome.
I'm a high school student that enjoy's programming, I mostly work in Java and C#, but I also know Python and some HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and ProcessingJS.

# What I'm Working on Now
I'm currently working on keeping my Minecraft mods updated, as well as a game in Unity to get better at C# and make some extra cash. 

# Projects I Have Done
Although I have programmed a lot of stuff over the 5 years I have been programming, most of it is unpresentable. Some work that I have released include 2 mods for the Java game Minecraft which can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/SmartFractyl/RedstoneHUD) and [here](https://github.com/SmartFractyl/RedstoneHUD-Waila-Edition). They can be found on the Minecraft Forums [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2091762-redstonehud-1-2-1-now-an-add-on-for-waila).
